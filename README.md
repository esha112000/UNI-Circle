## 🌟 Problem Statement
There is no campus-first, inclusive engagement platform where both domestic and international students can:
- Discover and join campus events tailored to their preferences
- Connect with peers who share similar interests or class/work schedules
- Reconnect with past event participants to build lasting friendships
- Overcome social isolation and fragmented event discovery across the university ecosystem

The result? Missed opportunities for cultural exchange, peer support, and a reduced sense of belonging especially for students managing academic and part-time work commitments.

## 💡 Our Solution – EverAfter

To create a trusted, campus-exclusive platform that fosters authentic, interest-based social connections among students domestic and international by simplifying event discovery, facilitating meaningful interactions, and strengthening the overall sense of community on campus.
We envision UNI-CIRCLE as the central hub for students to seamlessly engage in university life, regardless of cultural background, schedule constraints, or academic load.
